TF-IDF
TF(is,d2)                    This is a sent.
		      this is another is a is sent
   this a    is           another   sent.
d2 log(N/2)  3/7*log(2/2)                               0 	
d1							1/5*log(2/1)



d1 = a new sent
d2 = another sent				TF * IDF
d3 = a third sent a

a another third new sent

d1   1/3*log(3/2)			for a letter probability, log(no of doc/no of times occurance of a letter in doc) 

d2   0*log(3/2)

d3   2/4*log(3/2)
