For twin_prime.py

--> This programs generates a set pair of Twin prime number till the User's desired choice which he has inputed in the program. We also tried to consider
    special cases where User's choice of input is very large. Twin prime are those prime numbers which differ by two numbers.


For grayscale.py


--> This program takes any normal image (by default we provide an Capture.png image which you can easily change) and converts it into RGB matrix form from 
    there you can apply greyscale equation for converting the RGB matrix to greyscale image and also it saves a copy of greyscale image on the disk with 
    previewing the greyscale image to the user on the screen. It can support mostly any format of images for converting to greyscale image.

For summary.py

--> This program takes a csv file of US states COVID 19 stats. On the basis of it we perfromed some traversing and operation for generating the cases 
    regarding COVID 19 according to the User's input of States. It provides stats data in various form such as Mean , Maximum, Minimum, Standard Deviation,
    etc.
    User's kindly give the input on US States as First letter as uppercase.
    For example : Washington, Illinios, etc.


All the above programs works fine and I had given my best to optimise them to its best efficiency. Also I had provide the sample input and output and CSV files
which I had used in my program. Directories issue may not come as I had set path of all program in current file location. 

Also for running the above programs at best performance try to run them on Visual Studio Code.

Thank You
